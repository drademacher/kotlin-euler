# kotlin-euler

Currently I solve problems on project euler using the programming language Kotlin. Project euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. Previously I worked with Python, but at some point I made a switch to Kotlin in order to learn a new language. Learning a new programming language is done best by programming, so having a number of problems to solve is a good start.

Most source code is made to output a solution and is not beautified or commented.

People should not be encouraged to use the source code if one has not solved it before on their own.
